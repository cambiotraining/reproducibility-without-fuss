Download the data for this course and look at the `data/forensic-science` folder. Try to answer the following questions:

Look through the folder and try to answer the following questions about the project:

1. What are the conclusions of this study?
2. When was this study performed?
3. What are the questions that this study is trying to answer?
4. Which files are the data? Which files are the analysis? the output?
5. How could we make this easier?

The data are of course a mess. This is _not_ how you would like to tackle your analysis!

1. There are no clear conclusions associated with the study (it's not even clear which paper these data belong to).

We have two images: `graph.png`, which seems to show that life expectancy (of what?) increases over time. The trend is not the same in `draft_graph.docx`, so they're unlikely to be the same data set.
2. Not a clue. The only thing we can say is that it is after 2010, since the most recent data come from this year.
3. Probably the following:

* What is the trend in average life expectancy across countries, over time?
* What is the average life expectancy over time in Oceania?

4. We have the following: 

* **Files:** `data.xls` (probably how the data were collected, multiple worksheets); `data1_full.csv` (probably the data used to read into R); `data1.xls` (just the Gapminder worksheet); `oceania.csv` (the data for Oceania only)
* **Analysis:** `final_analyses.R`, `final_analyses1.R` and `rev1_final_analyses.R` all have very similar analyses, with different kind of filtering/subsetting and location of files (absolute/relative paths)
* **Output:** `graph.png` and `draft_graph.docx` show different things. `graph.png` has information on Canada (if that is the one generated by the script). The draft graph in the Word document is unclear, it seems like it was generated in Excel.

5. Sack the researcher who did this. More seriously, teach the researcher some good scientific practices. Some of the things we could do differently is:

* provide a README file with information on the data: when was it collected, by whom, what are the units etc
* organise the data and analysis: have a `raw` folder for the raw data, `processed` folder for data files that have been changed/subsetted (using scripts!). Keep the scripts in a `scripts` folder and use an `output` folder for images
* use leading numbers for the analysis files, e.g. `01_process-data.R`; `02_data-exploration.R`, `03_graphs.R` etc
* have commenting in the script, explaining what is being done; consider using some kind of markdown language (e.g. RMarkdown) to combine a narrative with code
* write down methods (e.g. statistical analyses) and conclusions in a separate file
